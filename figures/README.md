# üìä EEG Figures ‚Äì Chronotype and PVT Project

This folder contains key visualizations from the EEG analysis conducted during my lab rotation project on the effects of chronotype and time of day on cognitive control in the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT).

## üß† Overview

The figures include:
- **ERP overlays** for evening and morning sessions
- **Topographic maps** (scalp distributions) for selected electrodes (P3, P7, Pz)
- Time windows focus on the P1 and later ERP components

|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `morning_overlays.png`  | ERP waveforms from selected parietal-occipital channels recorded during the morning session |
| `evening_overlays.png`  | ERP waveforms during the evening session      |
| `P3_morning_topo.png`   | Topomap of P3 activity during morning trials  |
| `P3_evening_topo.png`   | Topomap of P3 activity during evening trials  |
| `P7_morning_topo.png`   | Topomap of P7 activity in morning session     |
| `P7_evening_topo.png`   | Topomap of P7 activity in evening session     |
| `Pz_evening_topo.png`   | Topomap of Pz activity in the evening         |

## üõ† Methods

- Data preprocessing in **BrainVision Analyzer**
- ERP and scalp plots exported from BVA and organized for presentation
- No significant group-level results were found, but patterns reflect individual differences in ERP amplitude and distribution

üìå *These plots were used in the final lab poster and demonstrate the analysis workflow, even in the absence of significant findings.*
