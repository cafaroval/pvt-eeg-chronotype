# EEG Lab Rotation Project: Chronotype and Cognitive Control in PVT

This project was conducted during my lab rotation in the Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, supervised by M.Sc. Hannah PlÃ¼ckebaum and Prof. Dr. Daniela Czernochowski.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To examine how individual chronotypes (evening-types) and time of day (morning vs evening) influence cognitive control and sustained attention in the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), using EEG.

## ðŸ§ª Methods

- EEG data collected from 20 evening-type participants (within-subjects)
- PVT administered at 8 AM and 6 PM
- Focused analysis on P1 ERP component (70â€“130ms) at visual attention channels (e.g., P7, P8, Pz)
- Preprocessing done in **BrainVision Analyzer**
- Statistical analysis in **Python 3.9** (repeated measures ANOVA)

## ðŸ“‰ Results

- No significant effect of time of day on reaction time or P1 amplitude
- Behavioral and ERP performance remained stable across both timepoints
- Project poster included in this repo

## ðŸ“Ž Files

- `poster.pdf`: Summarizes the study and findings
- `analysis_script.py`: Core statistical analysis 
- Screenshots of preprocessing steps in BrainVision Analyzer

## ðŸ“š Tools & Skills

- EEG data collection and preprocessing (BrainVision)
- Python for stats and visualization
- Study design in cognitive neuroscience

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

Although the study did not yield statistically significant results, it helped strengthen my skills in EEG preprocessing, analysis, and scientific communication.
