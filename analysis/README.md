# EEG Lab Rotation Project ‚Äì Chronotype and Cognitive Control in the PVT

This repository documents a lab rotation project focused on how chronotype (morningness/eveningness) and time of day influence sustained attention in a Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), using EEG measures.

## üß† Objective

To test whether evening-type individuals show time-of-day-dependent effects in their behavioral (reaction time) and neural (ERP) responses during a PVT.

## üß™ Methods

- 20 evening-type participants
- Within-subject design: EEG recorded in the **morning (8 AM)** and **evening (6 PM)**
- EEG preprocessing with **BrainVision Analyzer**
- Statistical analysis in **Python** using repeated-measures ANOVA
- Focused on the **P1 ERP component** at parietal-occipital electrodes (P3, P4, P7, P8, Pz)

## üìä Results

- No significant main effects were found for time of day on P1 amplitude or reaction time
- ERP data showed consistent morphology, suggesting **stable performance**
- Nonetheless, the project provided hands-on experience with:
  - EEG data acquisition and preprocessing
  - Visualization and plotting
  - Python-based analysis workflows
