# ðŸ“ˆ EEG & Behavioral Data Analysis Scripts

This folder contains the Python scripts used to analyze data collected during the PVT EEG lab rotation project.

## ðŸ“„ File Descriptions

- `EEG_analysis.py`  
  Prepares EEG-derived measures for statistical analysis, focusing on P1 amplitude across sessions and conditions.

- `behavioral_analysis.py`  
  Processes and compares reaction times across sessions (morning vs evening), including basic summary stats and visualizations.

- `demographic.py`  
  Summarizes and plots basic demographic distributions of the participant pool (e.g., age, gender, chronotype scores).

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- `pandas`, `numpy` for data processing  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization  
- `scipy.stats` and `statsmodels` for statistical testing

These scripts reflect the full analysis pipeline, even in the absence of statistically significant results, and demonstrate core research and coding skills for EEG and cognitive task analysis.
